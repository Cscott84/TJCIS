# TJCIS
re creating the outdated TJCIS website as a practice project. Very new to development and need practice to apply the skills i'm learning
I also want to learn how to use github while working on my first project after learning HTML and CSS for a few months

Here's the original website that's still live and running in 2019 https://www.tjcis.com/default.asp
